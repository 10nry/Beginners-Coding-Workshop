## HTML tips
* **everything is a box** - Think of everything you see on a website as a box. This will help you build and design the pages you create.
* **seek inspiration** - there are lots of websites to look at the source code of for inspiration of how things could/should be done.

## Headings
```
<h1>Top most heading H1</h1>
<h2>sub-heading</h2>
<h3>sub-sub-heading</h3>
<h4>sub-sub-sub-heading</h4>
<h5>sub-sub-sub-sub-heading</h5>
<h6>sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-heading</h6>
```

## Your homepage of your website
For this course and post sites, expect to see `index` as the homepage.
* Example: `index.html`

## Other pages in your website
* 'about.html'
* 'team.html'
* 'services.html'
* 'directory.html'
* 'products.html'
* 'contact-us.html'

## Link to other pages
The anchor tag `<a>` is what you'll use to create links to other pages and other websites.

Using the pages listed above, let's see a list of links that would help us navigate between the pages.
```
<a href="about.html">about</a>
<a href="team.html">team</a>
<a href="services.html">services</a>
<a href="directory.html">directory</a>
<a href="products.html">products</a>
<a href="contact-us.html">contact-us</a>
```

## Images example
An image is an `<img>` with two attributes `src` (source) and `alt` (alternate text).
`<img src="logo.png" alt="chick-fil-a logo">`
`<img src="big-candy-machine.png" alt="very big candy machine">`

## See example content in CodePen
This Pen is a CSS change, but it shows an example of content with images.

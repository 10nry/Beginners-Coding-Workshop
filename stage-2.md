## important to remember
* CSS is not intuitive. So, give it time and welcome to the party.
* CSS is cascading. Meading the last style overwrites everything before it. CSS goes in order from top to bottom

## selectors
* tag `div` would select all `div`
* class `.cake` would change all elements of `<div class="cake"></div>`
* id `#chocolate` would only select one `<div class="cake" id="chocolate"></div>`

## relational selections
* select `.cake > .layer` would select on the layer in the cake
```

<div class="table">
	<div class="cake">
		<div class="layer">this one</div>
	</div>
	<div class="layer"></div>
</div>

```
* select `.cake + .layer` would select on the layer in the cake
```

<div class="table">
	<div class="cake">
		<div class="layer"></div>
	</div>
	<div class="layer">this one</div>
</div>

```
